Project Description:
The project aims to develop a Simple Grading System that enables users to manage student records and compute final grades based on various academic components such as quizzes, assignments, and exams. The system will allow users to add, edit, and delete student records, as well as automatically compute grades and generate remarks. It will provide a user-friendly interface and implement real-time grade computations using event-driven programming.
 The system will allow users to:
Add records (student name, ID, subject, scores, etc.)
Edit records (update existing student or score details).
Delete records (remove student records)
Compute final grades based on entered scores (quizzes, assignments, exams, etc.)
Generate remarks (Pass/Fail or Grade Equivalent)


Programming Language Assigned:
The grading system will use OOP to structure the student and grade data into classes, and Event-Driven logic to handle user interactions like adding records or computing grades via a menu system.

Expected Challenges & Solutions:
Data Storage and Retrieval: Storing multiple student records efficiently.
 Solution: Use a normalized SQL Server database with proper schema design and indexing for fast queries.


Real-Time Grade Computation: Dynamically updating grades as scores are inputted.
 Solution: Utilize event handlers and data binding features of C# to ensure immediate feedback and updates.


Memory Management: Managing system resources effectively while handling large datasets.
 Solution: Leverage C#â€™s automatic garbage collection and use Dispose() methods to release unused resources.


User Interface Design: Creating an intuitive and responsive interface for users.
 Solution: Implement a clean layout with WinForms/WPF and apply input validation techniques.
